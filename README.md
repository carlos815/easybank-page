# Blog with CMS build with Gatsby

Check out the live demo [here](https://gracious-jennings-741304.netlify.app/)

Thanks to [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN/) for providing the design.

This is a fully functional blog build with Gatsby. It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

It was made using [this starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/)
